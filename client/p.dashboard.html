            <h3 class="title">5 Communication Tools That Saved My Marriage</h3>
            <p class="content">
              Early in our marriage, these simple principles changed our hearts and transformed our relationship.
              <br> By Rob Flood
              <br><br>
              We were blissfully in love and thrilled to be on our honeymoon. Then came day five—we had our first argument. That put us on a slippery slope moving swiftly toward desperation. Within the first nine months of our marriage, Gina and I were both convinced that we not only married the wrong person, but also were condemned to a loveless marriage.

One very tangible side effect of our difficulties was poor communication. I would ask, "What's for dinner?" She would hear, "I can't believe you haven't prepared dinner again tonight!"

She would say, "What time are you coming home?" I would hear, "You better get here and help me because you're never here."

We could not express anything we wanted to. We resorted to hurting each other with our words. We did not build each other up … we tore each other down and caused deep, emotional pain. Quite honestly, we had endured so much hurt that we could not see any hope for ever communicating well. Our despair was overwhelming.

In counseling we began learning about intentional communication. I remember thinking, "That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. This stuff is so simple … I can't believe I'm paying this guy for this."

But, once I got off of my high horse, I realized something very simple yet profound: If communication was really that simple, everyone would be doing it and all of our communication would glorify God and reflect His image (1 Peter 4:11; Ephesians 4:29). Glorifying God did not describe my communication, and it may not describe yours either. In fact, many of us struggle to communicate well even with those we love the most: our siblings, our parents, our children, our spouse.

The road I took to learn about communication was a tough one. Here are some of the tools that helped transform my marriage and change my heart.

            <h3 class="title">50 Ideas to Inspire Your Husband</h3>
            <p class="content">
              A wife has the unique ability to help her husband feel the freedom to reach his fullest potential as the man God has created him to be.
              <br>By Janel Breitenstein
              <br><br>
              There’s an old joke about one of our presidents walking with his wife, who sees one of her old boyfriends in a less-than-glorious occupation. The president looks at the old boyfriend and remarks, "If you hadn’t married me, you might be married to that guy."

The first lady answers calmly, "If I had married him, he’d be president."

Now, occupation is not the measure of a man. But as a wife, you do possess a unique power to inspire your husband. Your loving vision of the man he’s becoming propels him toward greatness—not necessarily by the world’s yardstick of success, or even your own, but by God’s.

When you believe in him, he is secure. He can take the leaps of faith required to surmount fear. He can bear up under pressure, pioneer new territory.

An inspired husband feels the freedom to reach the fullest potential of the man God has created him to be. He’s not merely encouraged. He's a man who's empowered; a conqueror. If you want to give your man some “wind beneath his wings”… start here.

            <h3 class="title">The Dream Wedding vs. Marriage</h3>
            <p class="content">
              A friend of mine finally walked out on her husband. She was tired of his excuses and irresponsibility. She was finished with his criticisms and cutting remarks. In her mind, enough was enough, and it was time to end the marriage.
              <br> <br>
              Yet as she described their relationship, I couldn't help but think that this marriage didn't need to end in divorce. There was no unrepentant adultery, abandonment, or repeated physical abuse. They were simply struggling with what most marriages deal with: miscommunication, financial disagreements, selfish attitudes—the things often excused as "irreconcilable differences."
              <br> <br>

              When I later talked with her, I asked if she knew that God said, "I hate divorce …" (Malachi 2:16). Or that Jesus specifically addressed divorce in Matthew 19:8-9 saying, "I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery."
              <br> <br>

              My friend said she heard this before and added, "But I cannot believe that a good God wants me to suffer in a bad marriage. He wants me to be happy."
              <br> <br>

              It was a response I've heard a dozen times from other women in similar circumstances, and it's a question that plagues the hearts of many marriages today: If God is good, could He possibly want me to be unhappy? Doesn't He see that staying in my current marriage would cause me a lot of pain? Can I call God "good" if He allows me to suffer in a bad marriage?            </p>

            <h3 class="title">5th Wedding Anniversary</h3>
            <p class="content">
              My wife is amazing!  <br>She is not your normal 31 year old woman. We actually met each other in Russia; she was a missionary there and I was on a trip with my church.  <br> <br>Long story short, we ended up falling and love and getting married. Now I could write a book about our life story about how we came together, how the odds were against us, and so on, but that’s not what this is about.
              <br><br>My 31 year old wife had a heart attack on December 7, 2011.  She is a health, in shape woman, which you would never put her and heart attack together. It was a rainy snowy day.  We were going through the busyness of the Christmas season, parties, getting gifts, about to celebrate Christmas for the first time with our seven month old beautiful little girl.  It was such a wonderful time.  And then the unthinkable happened.  My wife was heading home from work after picking up our daughter at her sitters; it was cold and rainy, so she took the back way home, of the interstate, so it would not be so hectic. Then it hit here, she could not breath. Blood coughing started.  Thank God she was on the phone with one of her close friends who said to call 911. So she did. I’m walking out of work and I get a call from a unknown number, which I normally do not answer, and picked up. It was a three-way with the 911 operator and my half breathing wife. I heard her cries, gasps, vomits, and moans.  I was told that an ambulance was on their way to her.  Before it got to bad she pulled over in a subdivision and got out and just laid behind the car so someone would see her to wait, Motionless on the ground waiting for the ambulance while our daughter was in the vehicle.  The ambulance got to her in 3 minutes, which is crazy for the time of day, everyone getting off work and all.  At this point no one knows what is going on.  I tell her I love her and I’m coming with her in the ambulance. I go to move my car out of the middle of the road and when I’m running back I see the ambulance leave. The firefighter says to me “she has to go, she is deteriorating.”   I’m stunned.  On the way to the hospital she flat lines 5 times and is shocked back to life.  Thank God I did not see that!   She gets to the hospital, they try to stabilize her. No one knows what is going on with a 28 year old’s heart.  Long story shorter, they finally decide to do a heart cath on her. They see a very rare, hardly ever diagnosed condition. SCAD – Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection.  The doctor is searching online and using other sources to figure out what to do.  Pretty much a vein in her heart split and caused a clot of blood. They tell me at first she will be incubated for a while and in hospital for 3-4 weeks; this will be a long process.

            <h3 class="title">God make us stronger through crisis!</h3>
            <p class="content">
              If we are going through tough times, we need to know why, and what we should do when we are in them. If not we become confused, frustrated and disillusioned. Yet in the Psalms we see David go through so much and still trust and obey more than most of us could ever do. And he does this without the New Testament at his disposal, or the scores of resources and places to seek help that we have. Yet David does ask God the hard questions, but he did not stop there. David also knew God intimately and trusted him wholeheartedly even in times of severe trials, and even going through them again and again. Just read though the Psalms, and see David's passion and conviction to God's call.
              <br> <br>
              We must first adjust the way we perceive life. Even as Christian sometimes we have faulty views and expectations we pick up by listening to bad teaching and bad advice and then there is the influence of our culture. First of all bad things do happen! And they happen to good people (in the way we see good, in God's eyes of course all have sinned and there is no good, except what Christ brings us). We will go through trials, troubles, and tribulations. So what we have to do is figure out what we do when it happens.
              <br> <br>
              What lesson do we learn from it, how do we grow better so we do not become bitter. We need to see His promise is:

            <p class="list-group-item-text">Our first date: I took her to an alpaca farm after she said thought they were the cutest thangsss. After sweet talking the farm owner, he let us walk into the barn where all the lil guys overcame their initial trepidation and then surrounded us in the most adorable way possible. After nuzzling with them for an hour, we went to Taco Bell. I burned myself horribly on an apple empanada, but it got her to laugh so I'll chalk that one up as a win.
            <br> <br>  I was 18, the whole date cost about $7, and I got her to smile a bunch, so yeah, that was great. <br> <br>
But you don’t need to be a teenager to get that adolescent rush. lutesolo remembers:
She drove an hour and a half to meet me in a poorly-lit gas station parking lot. We had a lot of time to kill, so we went to a restaurant to eat and start getting to know one another. From there, we went to a divey bar for a drink, where an extremely trashed teenager kept us company and told us all about her ex-boyfriend. Eventually we left and went to a nearby park, where we made out until a policeman shooed us out of the park.
All of this was leading up to the midnight showing of an indie slasher movie I'd originally invited her down to see. We stole kisses through the whole movie and laughed our asses off (it was intentionally funny).</p>
